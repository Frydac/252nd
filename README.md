252nd
=====

This project is a webapp (website) that can be used to get player in game times for the game "Planetside 2"

Currently it is set up for the in game group aka outfit named "252nd Spec Ops"

This website is hosted on github:
http://frydac.github.io/252nd/

It uses the Google Charts api, which has changed since I implemented this, and broke some of its functionality.
